GetData_Assessment_1
====================

When you run run_analysis.R the script will download the dataset, read in the apropriate files/values and create a tidy dataset, then write this out to tidy_first_full.txt

Once the file has been written, the script will summarise and create another data set with the average of each value for each activity and each subject, then write this out to tidy_second_summary.txt
